# Chromosome-Browser
A bioinformatics project that allows for the search for genetic information in a human chromosome.

## Description
The Chromosome-Browser project is a collaboration between IT and bioinformatics professionals to create a tool that allows for easy searching of genetic information in a human chromosome. The project consists of 3 essential parts:

1. The development of a database to store all relevant information on the chromosome. The database is deployed on a MySQL server.

2. A backend made in Python that requests data from the original database, selects useful information for the project, and passes it to the prepared MySQL database. This layer is also responsible for maintaining the data in the database and returning it to the third part of the project.

3. A basic web interface written in HTML and minimal CSS that serves as a search engine. Users can collect data and parameters to perform queries on the database using the selected parameters.

| Technology  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| MySQL  | Database management system used to store and retrieve genetic information  |
| Python  | Backend programming language used to request and process data from the original database and maintain data in the MySQL database |
| HTML  | Markup language used to create the basic structure of the web interface  |
| CSS  | Style sheet language used to add minimal design elements to the web interface |
